			Family is everything. That is what I have came to know in the past 3 years, and it’s the single ironclad rule I try and live by every single day, and I will not allow any person to exploit nor scorn or jest-ify them, which really grinds my teeth while looking at yassine, since his fiancee’s family seems completely aloof and distant most of the time with the lack of any approach from our end, and I still hate the unseriousness air whisking about as my dad was pouring his heart out in the little speech he wrote.
			Love, or rather liking and being awe-struck by a person, is nothing short of a drunken illusion that takes over one’s psyche completely; A fever dream where one can’t wake up unless they are granted control and snapped back to reality serendipitously, or they are awoken by the finalization of their hazy state, left with nothing but shattered hopes and dreams, and a chasmic hole in their heart, forever staining their heart that must be accepted as part of their new identity, or they shall forever live in the past.
			That is exactly why I fear drinking from the cup of enthrallment offered by the opposite gender once more, not out of fear of being rejected, rather fear of being accepted, and the eventuality of having both a part of me and my time plundered willingly.
