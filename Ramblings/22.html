			Seeing the twin twirling wax statuettes ornate with colors, crowned in a bellowing flame depicting the sum of the years I have lived so farn filled me with a certain dread; I couldn‚Äôt help but feel that the noose was closing in on me; I have no attachments to this life yet here I shudder at the slightest contact with the quicksands of time, in what way could I hope to vanquish these horrors and leash them at bay‚Ä¶ nothing, I thought to myself. 
			I silently blew on the lined up candles and I hoped my fears would be swept up all the same. I, 22 years of age.
